## üëã Hi there!

## üìäüìà Maven Sales Project

**#Business Objective**

To become a data-driven organization, we need to create an interactive dashboard that enables sales managers to track their team's quarterly performance.

**#Steps**

**1. Data Gathering**

There were 5 files shared

* Accounts
* Data dictionary
* Product
* Sales Pipeline
* Sales teams

**2. Data Preprocessing**

* Text data was trimmed in the tables to remove any white spaces.
* Column names were properly formatted
* Mispelled words were corrected such as:
    * "Technology" in the column "Sector" of the "Account" table
    * "Philippines" in the column "Office_location" of the "Accounts" table
    * "GTX Pro" in column ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù of the "Sales pipeline" table

**3. Data Modelling**

Four tables were already given and a date table was created so the managers can filter based on quarter and Year.

**4. Data Visualization**

These were the visualizations added to the Dashboard

**KPIs**

* Total Revenue
* Total Deals
* Average Deal Value
* Deal Win Rate
* Accounts:
* Avg. Deal Closure Time (DAY)

**Charts**

* A bar chart that shows total revenue by quarter
* A donut chart that shows the top 5 salespeople for the quarter, including revenue generated
* A pie chart which shows the top 5 most selling products
* A bar chart that shows revenue by sector
* A funnel chart that shows the deal stage funnel
* A bar chart that shows revenue by the regional office

The dashboard also allows managers to filter the data by several criteria, such as account, product, sales agent, regional office, sector and year-quarter.The dashboard also allows managers to drill down in the matrix charts there results to get an depth understanding.

**5. Analysis**

Some of the insights from the results:

* The highest revenue was in the Q2 of 2017.
* The most revenue-generating sales agent was Darcel Schlecht from all the quarters.
* The most sold product was GTX Pro.
* The most revenue-generating sector was Retail.
* The majority of the revenue was generated from the regional office in the West over the others from all the quarters.
* The sales manager Summer Sewarlds team generated the most revenue from the West office.
